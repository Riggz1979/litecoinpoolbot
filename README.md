Project Description:

The bot was developed as a final project for the "Python Developer" course by robot_dreams.

This is my first attempt at writing bots for Telegram.
The bot is designed to monitor mining on the pool: <a href="http://litecoinpool.org">litecoinpool.org</a>

It also includes several additional features.

Features:

- Mining statistics
- Hashrate watchdog
- Prices of popular cryptocurrencies (bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, ethereum)
- Ability to set alerts for currency prices
- Admin commands
- OTA updates
